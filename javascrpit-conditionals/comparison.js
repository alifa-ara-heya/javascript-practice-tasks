console.log(10 > 5); //true

var guavaPrice = 200;
var applePrice = 100;

console.log(guavaPrice > applePrice); //true

console.log(50 == "50"); //true, because double equal sign checks the value

console.log(50 === "50"); //false , because triple equal sign does not only check the vaule, but also check the data type.

console.log(10 != "10"); //false, it doesn't check the type, checks only the value. As 10 and the value of "10" is equal, therefore, the "not equal" sign returns false.

console.log(10 !== "10"); //true, it checks both the type and the value. And finds that while the value is same, but the type is not same. Therefore, returns true, because their type is not equal.
